# 🌤️ IoT-Based Air Quality Monitoring System

## Overview
This project is an Internet of Things (IoT)-based system to monitor indoor air quality.  
It measures **temperature, humidity, dust (PM), CO₂, and VOC** using ESP32 connected to multiple sensors.  
The collected data is sent over Wi-Fi and displayed in real time using the **Blynk IoT dashboard**.

## Hardware Used
- ESP32
- DHT22 (temperature & humidity)
- SGP30 (CO₂ & VOC)
- GP2Y1010AU0F (dust sensor / PM)
- I2C LCD / LED Display
- MB102 power supply / 5V regulator
- Jumper cables & PCB

## Features
- Real-time air quality monitoring
- Wi-Fi-based IoT communication
- Blynk dashboard visualization
- Suitable for classroom / indoor environment monitoring
- Can be integrated into smart building system

## System Architecture
1. Sensors read environment data.
2. ESP32 processes and formats the data.
3. ESP32 sends data to Blynk via Wi-Fi.
4. User monitors the dashboard in real time.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Internet of Things (IoT)
- ESP32 Programming
- Sensor Integration
- Data Visualization (Blynk)
- Basic Cloud/IoT Platform
